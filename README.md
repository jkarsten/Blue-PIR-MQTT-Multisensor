![Blue-PIR-Logo](/Documentation/Images/Blue-PIR-Titel.png?raw=true)

## Description
Arduino Code f√ºr a MQTT - Multisensor
This is a motion detection and multisensor device I've created. Built with an ESP8266, LED-Ring, DHT22, Lightresristor and a PIR Module. It use MQTT to transmit the values. This is only the Arduino Code for the Wemos D1 mini i used in the Multisensor i build.

You can find the 3D STL Files on Thingiverse https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3611186 
A building instruction is on my Website https://blue-pc.net/2019/05/06/blue-pir-mqtt-bewegunsmelder/
It is only in German but with many images.
